The paragraph provides a detailed explanation of LoRa, a long-range, low-power communication protocol widely used in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN). LoRa's reach extends up to 20 kilometers with low transmitting power, making it valuable in both academic and industrial applications. The technology has two main components: LoRaWAN and LoRa PHY. LoRaWAN manages the network, connectivity, and frequency operations, while LoRa PHY, a patentable part, defines the modulation and technical attributes of the system.
